# JavaScript Beginner Projects

Welcome to my collection of JavaScript beginner projects! This folder contains a series of small, hands-on projects that I built to practice and improve my understanding of JavaScript.

## Projects Included

Each project is designed to help reinforce fundamental concepts in JavaScript, such as working with variables, functions, loops, conditionals, and DOM manipulation. The projects range from simple exercises to slightly more complex challenges, perfect for anyone looking to build a solid foundation in JavaScript.

## How to Use

1. **Clone or Download** this repository to your local machine.
2. **Navigate** into each project folder to explore the code.
3. **Open the HTML files** in your browser to see the projects in action.
4. **Review the JavaScript code** to understand how each project was built and the concepts it demonstrates.

## Purpose

The goal of these projects is to provide practical examples of JavaScript in action. Each project was built as part of my learning journey, and I hope they can be helpful to others who are also starting out with JavaScript.

Feel free to explore, modify, and experiment with the code!

Happy coding!
